    <h1>Everything Everywhere all at Once</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><em>Everything Everywhere all at Once</em> is a 2022 American sci-fi with a hint of comedy-drama under the direction of Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert.
        It follows the life of a Chinese-American immigrant, Evelyn Wang, who is facing difficulties keeping her family together while keeping the business afloat.
        As if those weren't enough, she also has to deal with the auditing of the IRS. With the absurdity of her situation, she still manages to find herself falling into a 
        more dire situation where she discovers the existence of multiverse and it seems like she is the only one capable of saving it.

    </p>

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>The movie follows Evelyn as she is pulled into the multiverse, where she must learn to use the skills of her alternate selves to fight against Jobu Tupaki. 
        Along the way, she confronts her own regrets, reconciles with her family, and learns to accept kindnesss and connection to others. 
     </p>

     <h2>Settings</h2>
     <p>The film takes place on Earth, but spans alternate realities, each with its own rules which even reaches an absurd degree. 
     </p>

     <h2>Personal Thoughts</h2>
     <p>The film actively portrays the different cultural realities especially in an Asian perspective. It also showed different contemporary issues within the current population
        such as Jobu Topaki being a nihilist which may be a portrayal of the current younger generation. The relation of the Evelyn and her daughter also displays the stereotypes
        of an Asian family household, which isn't necessary true for all but a reality for a considerable amount of the Asian population. Parental issues and homophobia being 
        tackled within the film deeply resonates with me as this is a very common problem I observe within the majority of my acquaintances, typically in a minority group. The film
        overall left a very deep impression in me and I would recommend it to anybody looking for an action film that also would leave an emotional impact.
